This is a solution to the screening question:


By starting at the the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below.

      3
     / \
    7   4
   / \ / \
  2   4   6
 / \ / \ / \
8   5   9   3


We can see a traversal would be (3,7,4,9)

where the sum is 23, and this is the traversal with the max sum out of all traversals.

PROBLEM: Write a runnable program that obtains the maximum total for any triangle of that type (the faster it runs the better).
